It also has functions that have the same name and behave the same as some
functions found in System.IO, only Strings are replaced with ByteStrings. For
instance, the readFile function in System.IO has a type of readFile ::
FilePath -> IO String, while the readFile from the bytestring modules has a
type of readFile :: FilePath -> IO ByteString
