-- The Applicative type class as defined in the Control.Applicative module
--

class (Functor f) => Applicative f where
    pure :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
-- class (Functor f) => Applicative f means:
--  If we want to make a type constructor part of the Applicative type class,
--  it must be in Functor first.
--  So if we know that a type constructor is part of the Applicative type class,
--  it's also in Functor (so we can use fmap on it).
--
-- pure :: a -> f a means that:
--  It takes a value and puts it in some sort of default or pure context;
--  a minimal context that still yields that value.
--
-- (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b means that:
--  It takes two functor values, the first one with a function inside,
--  and extracts the function from the first functor value,
--  and maps it over the second functor value.
