-- A section is composed of:
--      * Road A
--      * Road B
--      * Road C (Crossing Road between Road A and Road B)
-- Section is a simple Algebraic Data Type
-- that holds 3 integers for the durations of its 3 road parts
data Section = Section { getA :: Int, getB :: Int, getC :: Int }
    deriving (Show)

-- A road system is splited into sections
-- RoadSystem is a Type Synonym represented as a list of Sections
type RoadSystem = [Section]

-- Heathrow to London represented as a RoadSystem
heathrowToLondon :: RoadSystem
heathrowToLondon = [ Section 50 10 30
                   , Section  5 90 20

                   , Section 10  8  0]

-- optimalPath should have the following type:
-- optimalPath :: RoadSystem -> Path
--
-- Path can be represented as a list of
--      * Roads (A, B or C)
--      * Durations
--
-- Let's introduce a Label type (a simple enumeration)
data Label = A | B | C
    deriving (Show)

-- Path is simply a Type Synonym of Labels and Durations
type Path = [(Label, Int)]

-- As an example, the heathrowToLondon solution should be:
heathrowToLondonSolution = [(B,10), (C,30), (A,5), (C,20), (B,2), (B,8)]
